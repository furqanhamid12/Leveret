            <h2>Care Tips to Prolong the Life of Your Pajamas</h2>
            <p>
                Proper care ensures your pajamas stay soft and durable for years. Leveret recommends washing their cotton and organic cotton pajamas in 
                cold water with mild detergent. Avoid using harsh chemicals or bleach, and always tumble dry on low heat or air dry to maintain the fabric’s 
                integrity.
